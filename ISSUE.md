# Issues

With this public GitHub site for the Toitware's IoT Platform, it is possible for our users to create issues wither as bugs or suggestions for enhancements.

## Issue categories

Look in https://github.com/toitware/public/labels for te available issue labels.

## Create an issue

When creating a new issue, choose a title which describes either the bug or suggestion in short.

Add a description to the issue where you describe in detail how to reproduce the bug and which version of the Toit console, the Toit CLI and/or the Toit SDK you are using. 
If you are creating a suggestion, add a detailed description to the issue.

Then, add a suitable label, or multiple labels if necessary, to the issue.

No assignee is needed. This will be taken care of by the Toitware team.
